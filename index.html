                 I am an avid backpacker, climber, and traveler that has accomplished several long-distance backpacking treks (of 300+ miles) throughout New Zealand, Norway, and the United States. Thus far in my life I've lived in 4 continent areas, and in 7 different countries - and have set foot (or boot) in many more beyond that. It is in no small part due to a fondness for photography, and a few strokes of luck,that I have found myself in a position to have so thoroughly experienced a number of countries and yet, it is these experiences that always has me wanting more.

                 I owe my desire to become a web developer not only to the changing world, and the technology heavy job market that we head into - but because the postion itself is inherently web-based. A career that would allow me to work from anywhere that I can find an internet connection, or find employment in any country that uses one of the universal coding languages, sounds like the right career path for me.
